                    <p>
                        First you write down your Life Goals, as big as they can possibly get.
                        Then think about what goals you would need to reach or what skills 
                        you would need to possess to be able to reach your life goals. These are you <u>Sub Goals</u>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then think, what would I need to do daily to reach my primary goals. These are your <u>Daily Goals</u>. This way your biggest
                        dreams get broken down into small, attainable and managable pieces. It’s the most effective and true way of creating new habits
                        and a better life for yourself.
