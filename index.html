                <p>
                    When trying to form your new habits, don't focus on goals. Rather focus on systems and 
                    your goals will follow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is why Habitect revolves around forming systems and making you consistent in your habits, your
                    goals can be a motivator but you shouldn't rely on only your goals to keep you going.
